# linearadvectionlily
Progress so far of numerical methods for solving linear advection equation. Building on Hilary's code.
diagnostics.py, advectionSchemes.py, initialconditions.py, and skeleton of implicitscheme.ipynb is hilary's code. implicitscheme.ipynb is main code.
finitevolume.py is the Lax wendroff scheme, implicitscheme.py is the BTCS scheme, FTBS.py is the FTBS scheme and CTCS.py is the CTCS scheme. Please ignore the comments referring to FTCS in files that are not FTCS scheme- i need to delete these comments but I copied and pasted your code for FTCS as a starting point for all the other schemes, so that's why they are there.
