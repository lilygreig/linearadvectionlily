# linearadvectionlily
Progress so far of numerical methods for solving linear advection equation. Building on Hilary's code
diagnostics.py, advectionSchemes.py, initialconditions.py, and skeleton of implicitscheme.ipynb is hilary's code. implicitscheme.ipynb is main code.
finitevolume.py is the Lax wendroff scheme, implicitescheme.py is the BTCS scheme, FTBS is the FTBS scheme and CTCS is the CTCS scheme. Please ignore the comments referring to FTCS in files that are not FTCS scheme- i need to delete these comments but I had just copied and pasted your code for FTCS as a starting point for all the other schemes.
